## Research Experience

### FaRMamba: Frequency-based Learning & Reconstruction-Aided Medical Segmentation — *Project Lead*  
*Jul 2024 – Mar 2025*  
- Proposed **MSFM** (multi-scale frequency module) + **SSRAE** (self-supervised reconstruction auxiliary encoder) within a Vision-Mamba backbone to recover high-frequency textures weakened by patch serialization and to preserve 2D spatial coherence.  
- Built small-animal **Ménière’s cochlea MRI** pipeline (protocol → quality enhancement → segmentation → radiomics); achieved **+1.36–6.63 pp** Dice/MIoU over strong baselines on CAMUS, Mice Cochlea MRI, Kvasir-SEG.  
- Designed **NAFA/INAFA** iterative fusion within a DIP–DKP paradigm for robust reconstruction with lower nonlinearity and compute. 

### Toward a Unified Paradigm for Sports Video Affect & Tactics Modeling — *Project Lead*  
*Mar 2025 – Oct 2025*  
- Defined **STAP** (Segment-level Team Affect Prediction) and event-aligned curation protocol leveraging referee logs, commentary, and ambient audio.  
- Built **TPAE** (team pose–affect encoder) with dual-stream fusion and reliability-aware gating; introduced **CSED** (cross-segment emotion dynamics) for inertia-preserving yet event-sensitive trajectories; obtained consistent F1/QWK gains on SoccerReplay-1988/NSVA.  
- Explored VLM curriculum adaptation with evidence-augmented DPO and an ordinal-evidential head for calibrated, player-centric decisions. 

### FIRM: Unsupervised Cross-modal (RGB/IR) VI-ReID — *Project Lead*  
- Implemented **prompt-injected token alignment** and **evolutionary prototype memory** (merge/split updates) to stabilize identity across views; OT-weighted contrastive learning improved Rank-1/mAP robustness on SYSU-MM01/RegDB.
